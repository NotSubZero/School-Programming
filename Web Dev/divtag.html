        <p>Since its discovery, the interstellar object known as ‘Oumuamua has 
            defied explanation. First spotted in 2017, it has been called an asteroid,
             a comet and an alien spaceship (SN: 10/27/17). But researchers think they finally 
             have the mystery object pegged: It could be a shard of nitrogen ice broken off 
             a Pluto-like planet orbiting another star.</p>

        </a>
        <p>A photonic quantum computer, which harnesses particles of light, or photons, performed a calculation that’s 
            impossible for a conventional computer, researchers in China report online December 3 in Science.
             That milestone, known as quantum supremacy, has been met only once before, in 2019 by Google’s quantum computer 
             (SN: 10/23/19). Google’s computer, however, is based on superconducting materials, not photons.</p>
